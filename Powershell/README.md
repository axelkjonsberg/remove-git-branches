# RGB for Powershell

You can add this function to your PowerShell profile so that it is available whenever you start a new session.

The profile file is typically found at: `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.

If this file does not exist, you can create it.

Here are the steps to add the function to your profile:

1. Open your profile file with a text editor (e.g., `notepad $PROFILE` or `code $PROFILE`).
2. Add the Remove-LocalBranches function to the file and save it.
3. Close and reopen your PowerShell terminal.
